# RailsbpInBrowser

This gem based on 'rails_best_practices' which is used to analyze the code of Rails project. The output of 'rails_best_practices' is not very readable, which didn't
supply more details on which code has problem. In order to get the specific code detail and it's problems, I created this gem.

It will generate a more specific output in html format and open it in your default browser for you.
